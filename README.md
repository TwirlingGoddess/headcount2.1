# HeadCount 2.0 

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.  

The application displays educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district and allows the user to search by district as well as compare stats between two different districts.

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, with Javascript, React, and CSS styling. It was tested with Jest and enzyme.

## Project Goals

* Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
